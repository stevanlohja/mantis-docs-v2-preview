# Why use Mantis

Mantis has more than regular ETC clients. It supports new features and is leading the ETC community towards new challenges by implementing improvement proposals suggested by community members.

Mantis is built for the following audiences:

  - **Node maintainer**: An Ethereum Classic user and supporter that wants to run a node, help with decentralization and diversification of node share*.
  - **Enterprise user**: If your company is testing and building on top of Ethereum technologies, and wants access to a client and wallet that is maintained by a leader in the blockchain space.
  - **Miner**: Mantis mining support is not yet ready for production environments. CPU mining is used on Sagano testnet for now, and GPU compatible mining is yet to be fully tested to guarantee the best capabilities and robustness.
  - **Someone who wants to test potential new ETC features**: If you want to test features including; Checkpointing- developed in order to help protect ETC against 51% attacks; and the Proto-Treasury- proposal to help maintain the node clients, the teams behind them and of course, the network itself. Other features will be available and are present in our roadmap.

> * Reminder that when client node share highly favors a single client, the risks of having security problems are increased. See [Ethereum's Shangai DoS attack](https://ro.ecu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1219&context=ism) for an example of the problem and [how having 2 strong clients](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/09/22/ethereum-network-currently-undergoing-dos-attack/) helped avoid consensus failure issues.
