# What is Mantis

Mantis is a full-featured *client and wallet*, that has been developed from the ground up and written in Scala for the Ethereum Classic network. Created by IOHK to add robustness and variety to the client share, it includes optimizations and network upgrades that improve network security, sustainability, and performance in the long term.

The software implements the official Ethereum Classic specification and Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals (ECIPs) introduced by ongoing efforts and discussed across teams in the ecosystem.
