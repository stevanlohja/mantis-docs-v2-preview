# Mamba Docs

Mamba docs is powered by [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## Local Development

### Install Dependencies

Install mkdocs-material:

```
pip install mkdocs-material
```

This will automatically install compatible versions of all dependencies: MkDocs, Markdown, Pygments and Python Markdown Extensions. Material for MkDocs always strives to support the latest versions, so there's no need to install those packages separately.

### Start Local Server

```
mkdocs serve
```

This will run a live preview server at http://localhost:8000/ with live reload. So, changes will automatically rebuild the site upon saving.
